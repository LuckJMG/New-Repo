## Background

The idea of this project came to me while I was practicing programming, as I am still a 17-year-old student, I usually do a lot of small projects to practice and upload them to github in case it can be useful to others, so after doing so many projects I decided I realized that I always put the same files and then executed the same commands at the beginning of every project, so I decided to make a command for the console that would create a new repository for me with what I always do at the beginning..

## Install

To install the command in your favorite shell, you first need to clone this repository:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/LuckJMG/newrepo
```

In the `/src/newrepo.sh` replace in the copy and paste files:

``` shell
cp -rT ~/repo/newrepo/src/files ./
# to
cp -rT $dir_newrepo/src/files ./
```

Then in your shell config file you need tu put this lines of code:

``` shell
alias newrepo="$dir_newrepo/src/newrepo.sh"
```

Replace `$dir_newrepo` with the direction of the cloned repository.
## Usage

To create a basic repository:

``` shell
newrepo test
```

and this will create a repository with the name `test`, put all the standard files and create the first commit, if you want to connect the repository with a remote one:

``` shell
newrepo test url
```

This will connect the repository `test` to the remote repository in the url `url`, and push the first commit with all the files.

## Thanks

I want to thank everyone who has come this far, this is another of my little projects as a 17-year-old student to practice, make my work more efficient and help the community, really thank you very much just for reading this.
