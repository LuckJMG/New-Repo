Shell module to create repositories more easily and fast, with configurations for diverse cases.

A shell module to repositories and connect easily and fast with the possibility to connect it to a remote repo, with configuration for diverse cases like node, python and web development, etc. This automatic repositories includes the basic files: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `.github` folder, `src` folder and `.editorconfig`.

## Background

The idea of this project came to me while I was practicing programming, as I am still a 17-year-old student, I usually do a lot of small projects to practice coding, and upload them to github in case it can be useful to others. So after doing some projects I realized that I always created the same files and then executed the same commands at the beginning of each project, so I decided to make a module for shell that would create a new repo fast and easy.

## Install

To install the module in your favorite shell, you first need to clone this repository:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/LuckJMG/newrepo
```

Enter the repository to give the executable permit to `install.sh` and execute it:

``` shell
chmod +x install.sh
```

Then in your shell config file you need to put this alias:

``` shell
alias newrepo="$dir_newrepo/src/newrepo.sh"
```

Replace `$dir_newrepo` with the direction of the cloned repository.

## Usage

Once installed you can create repositories more easily.

The newrepo command is formed by 3 essential parts: the call of the command, the type of repository, the name of repository, and 1 optional: the connection to a remote repository.

``` shell
newrepo -type name remote
```

The most basic command is:

``` shell
newrepo -d name
```

The type `-d` is the default type with all the basics without extras, there are several options that are mentioned in this table:

| Type | Description | Contents |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| `-d` | Default: Basic files without any extras. | Default files |
| `-s` | Standard: Repository standardization | Conventional Commits, Standard README and Conventional Changelog  |
| `-n` | Node: Repository made for coding with node. | npm init -y |
| `-w`| Web: Repository made for web development. | index file, css folder, js folder and img folder |
| `-p` | Python: Repository for python development. | setup file, sample folder with init and core files, and test folder |
| `-m` | Minimalist: Only essential files. | .md files and license |

Also, if you before created a github repository, you can link the local repo to the remote repo in the same command that creates the local repo:

``` shell
newrepo -d name url
```

## Thanks
